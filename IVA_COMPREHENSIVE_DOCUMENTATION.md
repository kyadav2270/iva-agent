  for (let i = 0; i < this.maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await requestFn();
    } catch (error: any) {
      if (error.status === 429) {
        // Rate limit handling
        await new Promise(resolve => 
          setTimeout(resolve, this.retryDelay * (i + 1) * 2)
        );
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Reliability Features**:
